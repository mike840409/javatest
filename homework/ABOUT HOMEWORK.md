# Homework

Refactor code in this directory.
To try the result in a simple way:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

And open your browser with

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## How to get points

* You need at least address all the Tier 1 issues to get 4 points
* You will get the extra 3 points from addressing Tier 2 issues
* However, you will NOT get any points from the Tier 2,
  if you fail to address ANY single issue of Tier 1
* You need at least the 4 points from Tier 1 to pass this class
* You can add or remove some code from the example. However, make sure every change you make is with clear intentions


## Tier 1 requirements

* Bind this in Event handlers
* Deal with object properties w/ constructor & prototype
* Deal with asynchronous flows with Promise
* Write your first test case for a pure function (as the last test of |test-list.js| file shows)

## Tier 2 requirements

* Implement functions with closure when it's necessary
* Avoid using closure when it shouldn't appear
* Write meaningful comments in JSDoc format
* (reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc#Example)
